# side_win_commander
This is a program to send commands to a specific window (another program) in Windows OS.
For example, this program can be used to send commands to any device connected to the computer.
Before we start sending commands, we need to find the required window.
The window is searched for by its title or part of the title.
Search pattern (string) should be specified in the form "Win finder" located at the top of the GUI.
If the search is successful, a green text "Target OK" will appear.
After that we can send our text commands to the application.
